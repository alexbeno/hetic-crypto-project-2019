# Fullstack GraphQL Workshop

Welcome! Today, we're going to learn how to build a GraphQL server using Apollo Server. Let's get started! ðŸš€

### Running locally

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/PayFit/hetic-crypto-project-2019.git`
2. Navigate into the repository: `cd hetic-crypto-project-2019/packages/hetic-graphql`
3. Install the dependencies: `yarn install`
4. Start the server: `yarn start`. Your server will be running on port 4000. Your GraphQL server will be available at `localhost:4000`.
5. Update the typings: `yarn generate`

### Slides

If you need to reference the slides, you can view them [here](https://slides.com/thibaultvieux/hetic-workshop).

### File Structure (in order of importance):

- `server.ts`: Where all the magic happens to set up Apollo Server
- `schema.graphql`: Your GraphQL schema goes here
- `resolvers/`: Write your resolvers for each type in this folder
- `datasources/`: Your data sources separate out the data fetching logic from your resolvers
- `connectors.ts`: Link the GraphQL server to a specific backend (eg. PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- `types.ts`: Map SDL types from the GraphQL schema to TS models
- `generated/`: Folder generated by the graphqlgen tool

### Branches

- `00-start`: Your starting point
- `01-apollo-server`: Setting up Apollo Server
- `02-schema`: Writing your schema
- `03-data-sources`: Building data sources
- `04-final`: Hooking everything up to resolvers

### FAQ

- **I didn't complete the last exercise and want to catch up**: No worries! I've created branches for all the steps in the workshop so everyone can go at their own pace. To check out the completed solution for your exercise, look for the branch above. In your local terminal, replace `01-apollo-server` with the exercise you're on:

```bash
git stash
git checkout 01-apollo-server
```
